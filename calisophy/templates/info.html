                Welcome to Calisophy! I'm Jedd, the founder, and I'm thrilled to have you here. 
                This platform is built for calisthenics enthusiasts like youâ€”whether you're just 
                starting or have been honing your skills for years. The purpose of Calisophy is simple: 
                to share knowledge, inspire growth, and uplift each other on our calisthenics journey. 
                Together, let's push boundaries, achieve our goals, and celebrate the art of bodyweight mastery. 
                Welcome to the community!
